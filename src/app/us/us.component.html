        <h2 class="fw-bolder">How It Started</h2>
        <div class="separador-centrado mb-5 mt-3"></div>
        <p>
          Class Design's story began over 40 years ago in the picturesque region
          of Andalucia, Spain, rooted in the bathroom manufacturing industry.
          With a passion for bringing exceptional European design and quality
          into every home, we expanded our reach to the United States over 12
          years ago. The inspiration behind Class Design stems from a
          deep-seated belief in creating furniture that becomes the heart of a
          family home, weaving warmth and togetherness into every piece.<br /><br />
          Our journey was not without its challenges. Translating the love and
          craftsmanship of our dedicated team into products that resonate
          globally required perseverance and dedication. Every milestone, from
          making our first client happy to reaching customers in far-off places
          like Hawaii and the Seychelles, has shaped Class Design into the
          beloved brand it is today. Our partnerships with talented developers
          and artists have further enriched our offerings, allowing us to
          continuously bring the best European designs to homes around the
          world.
